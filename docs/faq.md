### What is Fortify SSC?
<!-- What is SSC -->
Fortify Software Security Centre is the central system to which all the scan results/analyses are to be uploaded. It helps SAP developers to upload, analyze, fix, and track code scan findings.  
For additional details, visit the [Fortify - Official Documentation](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/Security-Testing/doc/fortify-doc/)

### What is Fortify SCA?
<!-- What is SCA -->
Fortify Static Code Analyzer is a set of software security analyzers that search for violations of security-specific coding rules and guidelines in a variety of languages. It produces analysis information that helps to deliver more secure software, as well as make security code reviews more efficient, consistent, and complete. Its design enables you to quickly incorporate new third-party and customer-specific security rules.  
For additional details, visit the [Fortify - Official Documentation](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/Security-Testing/doc/fortify-doc/)

I can also point you to the vendor documentation for SCA [if you are looking for it ;)]

### How do I reach Fortify SSC?
<!-- How can I login to Fortify --->
<!-- What is the URL for Fortify --->
Thanks to the Security-Testing team, Fortify-SSC is available centrally (as a service) to the entire SAP development community at [fortify.tools.sap](https://fortify.tools.sap/ssc]). It is also enabled with Single Sign-On, which takes you right into the application, assuming youve already registered (try the self-service if not already done)

### How do I register a new user in Fortify?
<!-- How to add new user to Fortify? -->
<!-- How to get access to Fortify? -->
<!-- I have never logged in to the SSC yet. How do I obtain credentials? -->
You are already in the right place ([Fortify Self-Service](https://selfservice.fortify.tools.sap/)) for that. Just click on "Register User", type in your D/I/C number and "Register". As simple as that!
You can even register DLs using "Register a DL" section on the Self-Service.

### How to get added to an existing project on Fortify?
<!-- how to get access to my project -->
<!-- Can you add me to the project  -->
<!-- requesting access to a project -->
Short Answer. **Not possible using the Self-Service!**.  
The self-service can only help you register/sign-up to Fortify SSC. However, to get access to your/your teams project, you will need to contact the content-owner (or someone who is already on the project).  
Additional details around "Why so?" are described [here](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/Security-Testing/doc/fortify-doc/access/#access-to-existing-application-versions)

### How to grant access to someone to an existing Project?
<!-- Grant access to application version -->
<!-- Provide access to project -->
<!-- Allow access to someone to my project -->
<!-- Grant permissions to view my project -->
<!-- What to do to give access to someone to my project -->
<!-- Can I grant access to a DL for my project -->
If you are the creator/owner of the project (or) if you have enough permissions to grant access to others, please follow [Giving Access guide](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/Security-Testing/doc/fortify-doc/access/#giving-access) to grant others access (checkout the video).  
**NOTE**: You will have to ensure they are already registered on Fortify first (either by someone manually, or by using the [self-service](https://selfservice.fortify.tools.sap/))!
